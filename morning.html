<p class="mon">Whoso stopeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.<br>
Proverbs 21:13>></p>
<h1 class="mnt">PRAYER</h1>
<p class="mot">Dear Heavenly Father,<br>
We come before you with humble hearts, acknowledging that you are our ultimate provider and sustainer. We are greatful for your abundant blessings in our lives.<br>
Today, we lift up to you the cries of the poor and marginalized in our society. <br>
we ask for your guidiance and compassion to be poured out upon them.<br>
Father, forgive us if we have ever turned a blind eye or stopped our ears to thier cries. Help us to see through your eyes and feel with your heart, that we may respond with compassion and love. Give us courage to take action, to reach out to those in need, and be a source of support for them. <br>
LORD, we pray that you may provide for the needs of the poor, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. open doors for them grant them opportunities for employment, education, and growth. may they encounter your grace through the kindness of others.<br>
May we learn from Proverbs 21:13 that by ignoring the cries of the poor, we risk having our own cries go unheard. Help us to be agents of change and love in our communities, reflecting your love to those in need.<br>
in JESUS name, we pray.</p><br>
