<span>Isaiah 54:17-</span>  No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.<br>
This is the heritage of the servant of the  LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.<br>
<span>proverb 18:10-</span> The name of the LORD is a strong tower :the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</p>
<p class="viid">God has given us maximum protection which works for the righteous who has faith and believe.<br>
Many verses in the bible has tell us about promises of divine security that God has for us.<br>
Some christians those not allow the promise to come to fulfillment.<br> Because of fear and doubt, forgeting that fear is the arrow that devil and his agent us against us to doubt our faith in God.</p><br>
<h1 class="vood">Did you know how many angels on duty about you.</h1>
<p class="woot"><span>Exodus 23:20-</span> Behold , i send my angel before thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared.<br>
<span>1 king 19:5-</span> And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.<br>
<span>psalms 91:11-</span> For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.<br><br><br>
Everybody has angels guilding he or she, giving account of your daily activities, offering help, and helping in decision makings<br>But some people has create a great distance between them and their angels Because of sin.<br>
A mark of sinful life makes them absence from you.<br>
