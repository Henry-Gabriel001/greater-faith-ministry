<P class="God">He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the almighty.<br>
<span>psalms 18:2-</span> The lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God ,my strength, in whom i will trust;<br>
my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.     <br>

<h1 class="heed">WAYS TO DRAW CLOSE TO GOD</h1>
<p id="heet"><span>*WORSHIP: </span> We draw close to God through worship, God loves when we glorify his holy name.<br>
Worship will make his eyes to be upon us day and night.<br>
<span>Exodus 34:14-</span>for thou worship no other god: for the LORD, Whose name is jealous, is a jealouse GOD.<br>
<span>*OBEYING GOD's COMMAND:</span> when we obey God's commandment, it create a bond of love between us and God, he will never allow us to fall into danger<br>
<span>*PRAYER:</span> if we always pray to God it automatically connect us with God like a bluetooth.<br>
</p>
<h1 class="moot">IS GOD AWARE OF ALL OUR SITUATIONS</h1>
<p class="toth">YES! God knows all things, Some situation comes to us as a test to our faith,<br>
some comes to us as a result of our sin/ disobedience to Gods law, and every sin has its punishment.<br>
But when he shows us mercy he will never allow the situation to over power us.<br>
Some situations comes to draw us back to God, especially when we think we are okey in every aspect of live.<br>
<span>Nahum 1:7-</span>The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.</p>
