      When your name is not found written in the book of life, an angel of
      distruction will lead you to the entrance gate of hell, where you will see
      many people standing waiting to enter into eternal death of sorrow.<br><br>
      <span>People are crying beging for forgiveness and second chance.</span

      Many people will be crying beging for second chance,<span

      young and old, male and female all in sorrow and tears shouting
      <span> "Had i know" </span>.<br><br>

        >THE floor beneath is getting hotter, yet your skin is intact but full
        of pain.</span

      Fire will be everywhere burning but the skin will never get burnt, the
      same fire burning a lier is the same fire burning a murderer.
