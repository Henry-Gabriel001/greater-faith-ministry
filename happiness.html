 <p class="haap">Some people seems to be born wuth a higher baseline of happiness, one large study showed that about 50% of overall life satisfaction cone from the genes and another 50% from external events and personal activities.<br>
While you may not be able to control what your "basic level " of happiness is, there are things you can do to make your life happier and more fulfilling.<br>
Even the happiest of people can feel depressed from time to time, and happiness is something that all people need to consciously pursue.<br>
Read GOD's Word and follow GOD's guide to happiness.</p>
