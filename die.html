Heaven is God's kingdom that is full of joy and happiness, where there is no sorrow, no pain and suffering.<br>
Heaven is God's own city full of angels and saints Worshiping God on his throne of Glory<br>
Heaven is a place where there is no sin.<br><br><br>
<u> WHERE IS HELL FIRE ?</u><br><br></u>
Hell is a place God made for  lucifer and his agents, but the sinful life of men has make them to partake in the suffering of eternal death.<br>
A place of torture and regret, pains , sorrow and thirsty.<br>
Hell is a place men shout for help and help never comes,<br>
Hell is a place of <span> "had i know" </span> <br>
Hell is a place where saten and his agents makes fun of men who fall by faith in christianity.<br>
Hell is a place for those who never listen to the word  of God, those who never believe that JESUS IS LORD.</p><br><br><br>
